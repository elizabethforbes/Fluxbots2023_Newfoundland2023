# Fluxbots and Newfoundland 2023
Repository for data, analyses, etc. regarding Newfoundland 2023 field and lab data, as well as data collected with Fluxbots network (Harvard Forest, Newfoundland, and testing in/out of the lab).

Newfoundland data include:
- soil characteristics e.g. organic layer depth
- vegetation surveys (ground to canopy, four layers total)
- soil carbon flux data (collected with PP Systems survey chamber)
- soil carbon flux data (collected in GMNP using the 3.0 fluxbots)
- soil characteristics (elemental analysis of total C and N for samples collected across the parks; bulk density)

Harvard Forest data include:
- soil carbon flux data (collected using the 3.0 fluxbots with improved/updated servo mechanism)
- meta-data (e.g. location in healthy or unhealthy hemlock plot)
- autochamber data (collected with the preexisting soil carbon flux auto-chambers at HF)

"Testing the fluxbots" data include:
- paired dataset including raw PPM observation intervals on the same collar, measured by both fluxbot (K30, passive diffusion) and Los Gatos Research device (flow-through)
- meteorological data from nearby weather station (obtained by colleague Ravish Dubey)

Analyses include:
- fluxbot raw data processing to produce flux estimates from observation intervals collected in NL, HF
- calculation of bulk density for NL soil samples
- estimates of aboveground carbon via vegetation surveys (NL)
- comparison of NL-collected datasets across forest disturbance gradient, moose population density, and park ID
- comparison of flux estimates collected at HF against preexisting autochamber estimates, detection of site differences (healthy vs. unhealthy)
- comparison of LGR and fluxbot-collected observation intervals, associated fluxes
