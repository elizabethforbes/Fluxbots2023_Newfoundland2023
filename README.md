# Newfoundland2023
Repository for data, analyses, etc. regarding Newfoundland 2023 field and lab data.

These data include:
- soil characteristics e.g. organic layer depth
- vegetation surveys (ground to canopy, four layers total)
- soil carbon flux data (collected with PP Systems survey chamber)
- soil carbon flux data (collected in GMNP and at Harvard Forest in MA using the 3.0 fluxbots)
- soil characteristics (elemental analysis of total C and N for samples collected across the parks; bulk density)

Analyses include:
- fluxbot raw data processing to produce flux estimates from observation intervals collected in NL, HF
- calculation of bulk density
- estimates of aboveground carbon via vegetation surveys
- comparison of all above datasets across disturbance gradient, moose population density, and parks
